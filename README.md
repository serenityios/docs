## What is Serenity?

Serenity, an iOS Third Party Store (Just like Scarlet, Feather, ESign, GBox and FlekStore) that allows you to sign any .ipa without limits.
For Free, you already get a 3 Gigabytes Max File Size upload, which is very good. And when you pay, the max file size can go up to 10 Gigabytes using the Serenity API.
