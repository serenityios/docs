# Errors

On this page, we will cover **ERRORS** and tell you what happened, and if there is a solution tell you.

## Parsing Errors

1. **"Parse Error: RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded."**
This Error, means that the info.plist of the .ipa is Malformed/to large or even the .ipa having nested ZIPs
Or Possibly: Recursion

I don't think theres any way for us to fix this.

For Now, we don't know any more Errors, please tell us in the Discord Server if you know any Error/Solution
