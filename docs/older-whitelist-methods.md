## Blacklist App
For iOS 16-16.5 there is a Blacklist App you can sideload before being blacklisted it runs a kfd/mdc exploit that automatically fixes your Apps and lets you open them and it stays whitelisted for days up to months.

Please Note: you need to keep the app open at all time, never close it or else you cant run the exploit once you get revoked.
