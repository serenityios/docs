# Using Certificates

Firstly, adding the certificates:

## Certificate Hub
If you wanna add one from the Certificate Hub, [This page will show you](docs/certificate-hub.md), however here we will not cover it.

## Custom Certificate
If you wanna add a custom certificate heres the guide:

1. Open The Serenity App ([if you haven't installed it heres the guide](docs/installation.md)) 
2. Click on the Third Icon in the Tab-Bar at the bottom (that looks like a pencil)
3. Click on "Add Certificate" this will show a page
4. In the page, input your .p12, .mobileprovision and .p12 password and hit Submit, these will save your certifiates so you don't always have to put it in again.
5. after that, you have a certificate added (For Devs, its in LocalStorage)
6. You can now Sign .ipa's from repositories or sign your own .ipa from the Signers page!

If you wanna know what happens to your certificates & ipa files, please read our [Privacy & Security Document](docs/security.md)
