# Using Repositories

First, you have to add an repository, [click here to see the tutorial](adding-repositories.md)

Now, lets get to the point; **Using Repositories**

After you have added a repository, and refreshed the page you will see the apps load, you can search through them by clicking at the searchbar and typing in the Apps name, it will show all of the Apps fitting within your search, click on one to open the page so you can sign it.

If you want to import an app from your added repository to an app like Scarlet/SideStore then on the App's page click the 3 Dots at the top right, click "Import to..." and you will see 5 apps to choose from which are  Scarlet, SideStore, Tanarasign, Altstore and Trollstore. Click on the app you want to import the .ipa to.

If you wanna download the .ipa from a repository, go to the app's page click the 3 dots at the top right and click "Install .ipa" it will take some time to appear wait 1-60 seconds then you can Click "More..." and "Save to files" then save it anywhere you want. (the speed of it appearing depends on the apps size and your phone)

To sign an app, its simple;
Go to the app's page, click the "Sign" button and after the process is completed, you can install it.

If you haven't imported/selected a certificate yet, you can [use this tutorial to import your own](using-certificates.md) or using one from the [Certificate Hub](certificate-hub.md)
